# USB

## Universal Serial Bus
usb stands for Universal serial bus and was invented and standardized in 1995. the first
motivation is to allow the peripheral automatically configured when plugged in your own
computer known as (plug and play) with out need to restart your computer.
usb has grown and become the most known interface for many industrial embedded
application.and the different companies after that move the direction of saving power and
reducing consumption by providing usb system sleep mode.
usb system consist of host and hubs, usb device can be self powered or bus powerd.
Usb has many transfer types control, bulk, isochronous, and interrupt each for a specific
purpose. different hardware implementation and PCB layout standards are required for
high speed signaling. Enumeration is a process follow attaching the device to start the
communication, descriptors store the host data during enumeration.
Implementation of PCB layout while using diffrent high speed signals. We will focus
on high speed layout guidelines for USB, USB Hubs, HDMI, Displayport, PCIe, SATA.
Concerns must be taken because high frequency signals are most impacted with other
signals.
LVDS is a high speed general purpose interface with low power consumption that have
a variety of applications.LVDS is characterized with low voltage swing in case of comparing
it to other industrial data transmission standards
